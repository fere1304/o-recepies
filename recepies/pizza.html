    <p>Indulge in the savory delight of our <strong>Pizza</strong> recipe.
       This Italian-inspired masterpiece starts with a perfectly thin and crispy homemade pizza crust,
       lovingly topped with a luscious tomato sauce made from ripe San Marzano tomatoes,
       fragrant basil leaves, and a generous drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
       The star of the show is the creamy, fresh mozzarella cheese,
       which melts to perfection, creating a harmonious symphony of flavors.
       Baked to golden perfection in a hot oven, this Margherita Pizza captures the essence of Italy in every bite,
       offering a simple yet sublime culinary experience that's impossible to resist. <strong><em>Buon appetito!</em></strong></p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105째F-115째F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</li>

            <li>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</li>
            <li>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
            <li>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75째F to 85째F) for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
       </ul>
